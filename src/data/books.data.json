      "Sister Francesca never asked for a life of violence. But when a shadowy cabal within the Vatican threatens to unleash an ancient weapon upon the unsuspecting streets of Venice, she discovers that prayer alone won't cut it.",
      "Armed with a pair of blessed nunchucks, an encyclopaedic knowledge of pressure points, and a habit that conceals more hardware than a Swiss army knife, Francesca trades the convent for the canals — and the sinners won't see her coming.",
      "From moonlit rooftop chases to explosive gondola pursuits, Nun More Deadly is a razor-sharp action comedy that proves the pen isn't mightier than the nun."
